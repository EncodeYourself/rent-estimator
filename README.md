# rent-estimator
Description:

A simple yet unique project for my portfolio. The goal is to create a model capable of assessing the rent level for apartments in Saint-Petersburg and estimate a rent range for the Object of Interest. 

The method:

To parse avito.ru, create a dataset from the extracted items fit it into a simple linear model.
After a few attempts with different linear models / settings, the residual analysis showed a clear pattern, so the data cannot be separated linearly. 
Had to abandon the linear model idea and used XGBoost. 

The result:

The result, to put it frankly, is quiteâ€¦ suboptimal. The dataset is quite noisy due to the subjectivity of the prices, maybe better features could help. Anyway, it is enough to access my skills.
