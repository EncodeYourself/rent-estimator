# rent-estimator
A simple yet unique project for my portfolio. The goal is to create a model capable of assessing the rent level for apartments in Saint-Petersburg and get a rent range for the Object of Interest. 
The result, to put it frankly, is quiteâ€¦ suboptimal. Was it my lack of experience, noisiness of the dataset or oversimplified features? I think all of them. Yet I guess the project is still good enough for you to assess my capabilities.
